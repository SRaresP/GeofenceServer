# GeofenceServer
The server that stores and retrieves information related to accounts and location for TargetApp and OverseerApp

## Todo

Fix the problem that causes the server to stop working in certain cases.

Implement registration and login for overseers.

## Done

Server scaffolding is done, now only lacks implementation and polish.

Can currently receive and send data to TargetApp.

Implemented unique code generation, automatic removal and validation.

Implemented proper hashing for unique codes. I forgot I could just use the code I wrote like a year ago...
